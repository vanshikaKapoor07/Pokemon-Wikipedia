<h4>Statistics of weight loss</h4>
<p>The AR game's potential for weight
loss was a big part of that discussion.
In the process of getting out their doors and
visiting parks, players found they were losing
weight almost in spite of themselves. 
A Reddit Pokémon Go fan won acclaim for
reporting that he'd lost 65 pounds between
July and December.

<h2>Q and A</h2>
<h3>Questions Every Pokemon 
        Trainer Should Be Able To Answer</h3>
<div class="list">
<ol type="1">
<li><b>What Pokemon does Pikachu evolve into?</b></li>
<ul>
<li>We're sure you know this Electric mouse Pokemon, and you know it quite well. Basic knowledge of Pikachu is essential for every trainer, but you should also be well versed in the rodent's evolutionary chain. Pikachu, mighty as it is, has an even stronger evolved form also capable of generating vast amounts of electricity. Maybe you've bumped into this species in the wild. Either way, this is a question 
    all Pokemon trainers should be able to answer.</li>
<li>Answer is Raichu</li>
</ul>
<li><b>What's the most effective Poke Ball in the game?</b></li>
<ul>
<li type="space">Not all Poke Balls are made equally. There's the basic model you 
            start your journey off with, but progressive upgrades
             are needed if you're looking to keep up with some of
              the stronger wild Pokemon who emerge in 
              later routes. If you've made your way 
              through any Pokemon game, you've reached 
              the point where you're presented with 
              the most effective Poke Ball known to man. 
              This is a one shot catch, and no button 
              mashing at all is required.</li>
<li> Answer is Master Ball</li>

    multipliers to the main Pokémon games -<br>
    although a December 2018 update brought<br>
    them slightly closer in line.

               Green for the Game Boy in Japan. 
               When these games proved popular,
                an enhanced Blue version was released 
                sometime after, and the Blue version
                 was reprogrammed as Pokémon Red and
                  Blue for international release. The
